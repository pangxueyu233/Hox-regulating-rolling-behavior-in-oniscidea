## Overview of submitted data

The majority of our data in this paper was RNA-seq data. And we submitted all the Rmarkdown files and important processed files to documents respectively. 

## 1. ```code_of_prat1_analysing```

This Rmarkdown files recoded processed steps in de novo whole transcripts reconstruction and homology calculation and quantification based on base sequences. And it could be found by [clicking here](code_of_prat1_analysing.md)

## 2. ```code_of_part2_analysing``` 

This Rmarkdown file recoded ```figures making```processed steps with ***Code and Graph***.  All the processed files could be downloaded in ```processed_files``` 

For Figure1 codes, you could find by [clicking here](Figure1_Making.md).

For Figure2 codes, you could find by [clicking here](Figure2_Making.md).

For Figure3 codes, you could find by [clicking here](Figure3_Making.md).

For Figure4 codes, you could find by [clicking here](Figure4_Making.md).

## 3. ```processed_files``` 

All the processed files mentioned in ```code_of_part2_analysing.md```  had been stored in this document. And GFF files of **oniscidea** were also stored in [here]( [GFF_files](processed_files\GFF_files) ).

``rolling_longest_orfs.gff3`` is the genomics annotaion information for rolling oniscidea samples.

```stretching_longest_orfs.gff3```  is the genomics annotaion information for stretching oniscidea samples.
