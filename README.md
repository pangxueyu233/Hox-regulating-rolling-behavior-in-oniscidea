## Overview of submitted data

The majority of our data in this paper was RNA-seq data. And we submitted all the Rmarkdown files and important processed files to documents respectively. 

## 1. ```code_of_prat1_analysing```

This Rmarkdown file recoded processed steps in de novo whole transcripts reconstruction and homogeneity of variance quantification. And it could be found by [clicking here](code_of_prat1_analysing.md)

## 2. ```code_of_part2_analysing``` 

This Rmarkdown file recoded ```figures making```processed steps with ***Code and Graph***.  All the processed files could be downloaded in ```processed_files```
