# Roly Poly project

## Backgroud

Roly Poly -->>  development

Hox genes function -->> life development

curl and straight -->> ???

## Results

### 1. phenotype data

### 2. Homological analysis (curl and straight)

- identified similarity between Roly poly and others species.
  - STAR (Aligment with other species genome references)
    - Roly poly and Drosophila
    - Roly poly and mosue
    - Roly poly and human
  - quantified reads counts on annotated genes
  - de novo Genomics from RNA-seq by Trinity.
  - MUMmer3.23 (Aligment with other species genome references)
    - Roly poly and Drosophila
    - Roly poly and mosue
    - Roly poly and human
  - quantified similar regions on annotated genes
- calculate differences of similarity score on HOX genes/region family between curl and straight
